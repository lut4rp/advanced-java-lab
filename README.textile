h1. Advanced Java Lab

I had Advanced Java in 8th semester during college. These are the LaTeX sources of the practical file I made.

h2. Files

|_.File|_.Description|
|mainpage.tex|Main file, that should be compiled|
|applets.tex|Java applet demo|
|exception.tex|Exception handling|
|multithreads.tex|Multithreading|
|clientserver.tex|Client - server architecture|
|sqlconnect.tex|SQL connectivity using ODBC|
|rmi.tex|RMI (Remote Method Invocation)|

h2. Warning

My college is weird, teachers are strange and the syllabus is lame. The sources here might seem like a joke but this is what it is. DON'T PANIC.
